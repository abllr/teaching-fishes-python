## Exercices 

This lesson builts for the next lesson that will discuss algorithms and trading strategies mainly Triangular Arbitrage .



### Basics 

* Explore the Binance Docs and try and fetch and write tiny functions that explore data
* Follow this [tutorial](http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tutorial.html) to store a data you like (marketdepth,trades ...) 

### Processing

* After storing a dataset you like write a set of functions to help filter and explore the data :
    * For example print all buy orders superior than 10 bitcoin
    * What is the current bid/ask level

* Build an example program that follows  composability (your code is functions) that fetches the last Trades of 4 Pairs of your choice 
filter the trades and sort them by quantity then store the data you fetched in a MongoDB database

* Build a second program that communicates with the MongoDB database and fetches the top 10 trades by size
